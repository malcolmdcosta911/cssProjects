/* The purpose of forwards (also known as fill-mode: forwards) is to maintain the final state of the animation after it completes. 
In this case:
When the typing animation finishes, instead of reverting to its initial state (which would cause the text to disappear), it keeps the final state.
This means that once all the characters have been typed out, they remain visible. */

/* step-end is an alternative way to write steps(1) in the animation-timing-function property. It specifies that the animation should complete at the last frame.

In the context of the blinking cursor:

step-end ensures that the cursor stays at the end of the text when it blinks.
Without it, the cursor might jump between positions during the blink cycle. */
